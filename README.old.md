# Summner of Tech 2018: JavaScript (React) Masterclass, Part 1

Please install the following software _before_ attending the class. We will not have time to work with you individually or to wait while you install software during the class&mdash;especially if many people are attempting to download simultaneously. If you really can't get everything installed&mdash;even after searching for help online&mdash;then please contact us through Summer of Tech and we'll try to help.

## Setup

### Node

First and foremost, you must have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. We run the Current version so it is best if you do, too. (That is, don't install the LTS version unless you have to.)

### Yarn

Once you have node.js installed, install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install). We'll be using yarn throughout the demo, so it will make it easier for you. However, if you're very familiar with **npm**, then you're welcome to use it instead.

### An IDE or code editor

You'll need some way to write and edit code. We'll be using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), the most popular code editor, and we highly recommend that you do, too, unless you are already very comfortable with another editor (e.g, Atom, Sublime Text). An IDE is really overkill for what we have planned, but if you can't live without one, then that's OK, too.

Note: you don't have to uninstall or give up your favourite editor to use VSCode for this class. They can coexist peacefully!

We'll be using a few extensions for VSCode during the class. We recommend that you install them, too. There are generally equivalents for other code editors/IDEs if you're sticking with some other app.

### ESLint

We'll be using ESLint to check our code syntax. Wikipedia defines linter or lint thus: _tools that analyse source code to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs_. ESLint will help you to write better code.

VSCode has an [ESLint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint), as do most code editors.

### Prettier

We'll also be using a code formatter to format our code to [JavaScript Standard Style](https://standardjs.com/). This keeps our code style consistent across files and applications and makes it easier for others to read and understand our code.
