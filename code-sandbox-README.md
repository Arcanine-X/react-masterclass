## JavaScript (React) Masterclass, Part 1

## CodeSandbox.io version

Use these instructions if you prefer to complete the Masterclass using [codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io/).

Simply open your browser to [our application template](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/test-er-8-or/tic-tac-toe/tree/00-set-up), then click the "Fork" button to create your own copy of the code. Bookmark that URL. You can come back to it at any time. We've done all the set up for you.

This is the fastest way to go, but it does have some drawbacks. For one thing, set up and configuration is, we kid you not, the _hardest_ part of being a programmer. And the most annoying. The sad truth is that programmers (and especially web developers) spend way more time than we should trying to get everything set up and working properly. Efforts at standardisation and virtualisation have improved things somewhat, but there is still a long way to go.

So doing the set up the long way might be worth the trouble. You'll have to do it eventually anyway&mdash;you can't build all your apps in CodeSandbox!

The other drawback is that you have to be online to work, and if connectivity is iffy, that could be a problem. With many Masterclass students using the network simultaneously, we can't guarantee a fast or consistent connection. Be warned.

If you use this method, we strongly recommend that you register for a GitHub account (if you don't already have one) and log in with GitHub. That will give you extra superpowers that you may need to complete the Masterclass.

See you soon!
